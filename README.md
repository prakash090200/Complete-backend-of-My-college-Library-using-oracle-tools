### Complete backend of my college Library-using-oracle-tools
Its a  University Library  for both Faculty and Student. The Library accommodates a collection of Books, Journals, Monographs and Transactions.Proper Database is maintained and proper Timing is maintained for students and teacher to issue and return books.
Students need ID cards to get entry in libraries, and not allowed to carry more than 2 items  (done using procedure in PLSQL)
An Online Library portal is also maintained so that users can view information about their
issues (like Return date, late fee, etc.). The Library also keeps E-books which can be
accessed only by the faculty through an online portal. Monographs and Journals
published by the faculty is also kept in the Library which can be issued by students and
faculty. Plenty of studying space is available in the building and a very peaceful
atmosphere is maintained. Book issuing process is also fast as it happens using automatic
book sensors. Every book has number of copies hence every copy can be identified
uniquely. Administrators have access to the Library Database which has details about
every Faculty and Student and all their transactions with the Library. The Library only
provides to the students of the University and not from outside.
